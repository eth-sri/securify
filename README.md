# Securify

![securify](/img/foundation_securify.png)

Securify is a security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts supported by the
[Ethereum
Foundation](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/)
and [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com). The core
[research](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/ccs18-securify.pdf)
behind Securify was conducted at the [ICE Center](http://ice.ethz.ch) at ETH
Zurich.

It features an extensive list of security patterns commonly found in smart
contracts:

* some forms of the DAO bug (also known as reentrancy)
* locked ether
* missing input validation
* transaction ordering-dependent amount, receiver and transfer
* unhandled exceptions
* unrestricted ether flow


The project is meant to be an open platform welcoming contributions from all of the
Ethereum Security Community. To suggest new patterns, to volunteer for testing or to
contribute developing new patterns please get in touch through our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/nN77ckb) group.

## Getting Started
### Requirements

* Soufflé: https://github.com/souffle-lang/souffle/releases (Securify should work with
  the latest package, please raise an issue if it does not). If you cannot
  install Soufflé, look at the Docker container for an alternative. Securify
  will crash without the `souffle` binary.
  As of writing, Soufflé is not available on Windows, so Securify should not be
  expected to run on Windows either.
* Java 8
* A `solc` binary is required to be able to use Solidity file as input.
  Securify assumes that the right version is installed for the given file.
  `solc` is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).

### Use

To build:
```sh
./gradlew jar
```

To run Securify on a Solidity file:
```sh
java -jar build/libs/securify.jar -fs src/test/resources/solidity/transaction-reordering.sol
```

To run Securify on the decompilation output provided by the [pysolc.py
script](scripts/pysolc.py) (which requires py-solc):
```sh
java -jar build/libs/securify.jar -co out.json
```

To run Securify on some EVM binary (produced e.g. by `solc`):
```sh
java -jar build/libs/securify.jar -fh src/test/resources/solidity/transaction-reordering.bin.hex
```

To see the full list of options:
```sh
java -jar build/libs/securify.jar -h
```

To run the tests (which use JUnit4):
```sh
./gradlew test
```

A Python wrapper helps to deal with `solc` and `truffle`. The requirements are
in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. The Dockerfile can be used as
a reference to set-up your local environment to use this wrapper.

### Docker

The installation should be simple enough on Debian derivatives, or any other
platform supported by Soufflé.

For a quick demonstration which does not require Soufflé, you can use Docker.

Build the Docker image:
```sh
docker build . -t securify
```

Run Securify on a small example:
```sh
docker run securify
```

You can change the files analyzed by specifying a volume to mount, and every
`*.sol` file contained will then be processed by Securify:
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/folder_with_solidity_files:/project securify
```

Adding a `--truffle` flag should allow Securify to run over Truffle project in
which dependencies have already been installed (so run `npm install` before if
need be). Without this flag, the project is compiled using `solc`. Add a `-h`
to obtain the full list of options. In particular, if the user wants to receive
compilation information from Truffle, he should add the `-v` flag.

If one wants to receive JSON output, the docker supports a `--json` flag that
will suppress the pretty output and return JSON instead. Make sure to add the
`-q` flag if no progress information should be displayed, hence resulting in
pure JSON output. The indices of the lines matched are 0-based, meaning that
a match to line `i` means that the `i+1`th line is matched. In particular, the
first line has an index of 0.


### Tests

Basic end to end tests can be run through the [test.py](test.py) file:
```py
python3 test.py
```

The requirements can be installed using Pipenv:
```sh
pipenv install
```

or using `pip`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These tests compare the current json output given by Securify with some past
output, and report differences between the two.

### Travis Integration

You can add the following `.travis.yml` to your project to run Securify on new
commits:
```
services:
  - docker

before_install:
  - docker pull chainsecurity/securify

script:
- docker run -v $(pwd):/project chainsecurity/securify
```

This should allow Securify to run over Truffle project in which dependencies
have already been installed (so run `npm install` before if need be).

### Output

The output loosely follows the clang style. Only warnings and vulnerabilities
are reported. If one wishes to also get the compliance information, please use
the `--json` flag in the docker, or `-co` flag on the Java executable to get
all analysis information in JSON format.

## Known Limitations

Although Securify is regularly used to help audits at ChainSecurity, there are
still bugs, including:
* the code in  the fallback function is currently not analyzed. A workaround is
  to name this function instead.
* in some cases, a StackOverflowError exception is thrown, due to
  `computeBranches` being recursive. In most cases,
  it is enough to increase the stack size using the `-Xss` option of `java`,
  e.g. `java -Xss1G -jar ...`.
* libraries are not properly supported
* abstract contracts (whose binary cannot be obtained via `solc`) are not
  supported

## Technical details

Securify statically analyzes the EVM code of the smart contract to infer
important semantic information (including control-flow and data-flow facts)
about the contract. This step is fully automated using
[Soufflé](https://souffle-lang.github.io/), a scalable Datalog solver. Then,
Securify checks the inferred facts to discover security violations or prove the
compliance of security-relevant instructions.

The full technical details behind the Securify scanner are available in the
[research
paper](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/ccs18-securify.pdf).
